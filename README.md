## Easy Living
Easy Living is a Internet of Things project based on a microservice architekture.

The finished result should be able to take alot of different sensor and do a task based on the readings from that sensor.
For an example, it could be a pir sensor that registeres movement and send a signal to a relay, that turns on the light in that area.

This will be a prototype with a minimal working order. But as i am gonna use this project on our old farm, this project is over time gonna be developed.

#### Constraints
This will as stated a minimal prototype, so the first version will only support a few sensors and a relay to make a proff of concept.


#### Logical Data Model




#### Use cases


#### Text based Use Cases


#### Sequence diagram.


#### Overview of the architecture

#### process and thoughts

#### furture work
